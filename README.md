## To add more Button Mappings:

- Use an existing mapping as a guide. JSON mapping files are located in [./src/mappings]().
- Create the new JSON mapping file in this folder.
- Add the entry to `./src/mappings/mappings.js`. The ID should be the same as the filename.
- Submit both the modified `mappings.js` and new controller mapping as a Pull Request for review.
